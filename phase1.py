#To demonstrate the input and output statement in python
#A python program that computes the AREA OF A CIRCLE in PHASE 1
#Since PIE is constant as 3.142, and RADIUS is given to be 5
#Using the FORMULA : Area of a circle = pie * (radius**2)



pie = 3.142
radius = 5
area = pie * (radius**2)
print("area of a circle =" , area)
#End
